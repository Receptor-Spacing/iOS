# iOS
This educational app visualizes a short‑term “Receptor Engagement Index” (REI) for the serotonin 5‑HT2A pathway. It helps you see how session timing affects near‑term sensitivity and recovery—encouraging spacing, not stacking. The app never recommends doses and never encourages use.

## What you can do

- Log sessions with neutral “intensity” labels and timestamps.
- View a timeline with three lines:
   - Saturation (green): modeled engagement signal.
   - Intoxicated (red): immediate effects envelope with compound‑specific decay.
   - Sensitivity (navy): short‑term desensitization envelope recovering over days.
- Pan and pinch‑to‑zoom horizontally (down to 15‑minute resolution).
- See multi‑session interactions across a wide window around “now”.
- Read “About the Model” for plain‑language math, assumptions, and citations.

## Privacy and accessibility

- No account. On‑device storage only. Analytics default off.
- Respects Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and Reduce Motion.
- Neutral language throughout (“session” and “intensity”).

## Supporter unlock (optional)

An optional, non‑consumable in‑app purchase removes the interstitial shown before results. Any “coffee” tier unlocks permanently; restore on any device via Settings → Supporter. If offline or you choose not to purchase, you can always continue after a short countdown.
