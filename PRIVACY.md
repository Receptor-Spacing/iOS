# Privacy Policy — Spacing
Effective: 2025-09-17

Spacing is an educational visualization app that models short‑term receptor engagement and recovery. It does not provide dosing advice or medical guidance.

We respect your privacy. The app is designed to store data on your device only and to avoid collecting personal information.

## Summary (Data Not Collected)
- No account, no login, no cloud sync.
- No personal data collection, no tracking, no ads.
- Session entries and app settings are stored locally on your device.
- Optional non‑consumable in‑app purchases are processed by Apple; we do not see or store your payment details.

## Information We Do Not Collect
Spacing does not collect, transmit, or sell:
- Contact info (name, email, phone, address)
- Health, sensitive, or biometric data
- Location data
- Contacts, photos, files, or calendar
- Identifiers (advertising ID, device fingerprint)
- Usage analytics or crash logs (outside of Apple’s optional, aggregated reporting)
- Browsing history or search history

We include no third‑party analytics SDKs and do not share data with advertisers or data brokers.

## Data Stored On Your Device
The following data may be stored locally on your device and never leaves it unless you back up your device or explicitly share it:
- Session entries (time, substance, neutral “intensity” values)
- App preferences (e.g., sampling step, researcher mode)
- A supporter/unlock flag after successful purchase

You can delete local data at any time by removing sessions in the app or by uninstalling the app, which removes all app data from your device.

## Purchases & Payments
Spacing offers optional, non‑consumable in‑app purchases (“coffee” tiers) to support development.
- Purchases are processed by Apple using StoreKit. We do not receive or store credit‑card details or billing information.
- We receive only what is necessary to unlock the feature on your device (e.g., product identifier and transaction status). This information is not linked to your identity by us.
- You can restore purchases on any device signed into the same Apple ID using “Restore Purchases” in Settings.

## App Store & Platform Diagnostics
Apple may provide us with aggregated, non‑identifying metrics (e.g., downloads, crashes) through App Store Connect. If you opt in at the system level to share analytics or crash logs with developers, Apple may share anonymized information with us. We do not combine this with any other data or attempt to identify you.

## No Tracking
Spacing does not track you across apps or websites and does not use advertising identifiers.

## Children’s Privacy
The app is intended for adults (18+). It does not target or knowingly collect data from children.

## Security
Because Spacing keeps your entries on‑device and does not maintain servers, your data benefits from your device’s native security (passcode, biometrics, and encryption at rest). Always keep your device software up to date and use strong device security.

## Your Choices
- You are not required to provide any personal information to use the app.
- To remove all local data, uninstall the app. To remove only session entries, delete them in the app’s History list.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect improvements or regulatory changes. We will update the “Effective” date and publish the latest version on our website and/or in the app.
